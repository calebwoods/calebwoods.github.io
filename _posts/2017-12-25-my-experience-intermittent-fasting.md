I've been experimenting with intermittent fasting for the last 6 months as my latest health experiment. It has been had such a positive impact on me and I've wanted to find more ways to share the concept with others which I hope this post does.

### Starting Point

In the same way that I look to apply experiments to my work in software development, I've done the same with health and fitness over the years and had some short-term success.  My wife and I did a strict [Paleo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet) diet for 9 months several years ago and while we don't still eat strictly Paleo it helped shift our diet to be higher in real foods and lower in carbs.

However, since my oldest Elon was born 2.5 years ago I've found it hard to keep up a regular exercise routine and keep weight off.  I also have seen my cholesterol and blood pressure reach the high side of acceptable and decided it was time to make a change after not having success with simply cutting calories.

### Getting Started

Over the last few years, I've heard about fasting a few times on various podcasts I listen to, but hadn't tried it as it seemed like it would be difficult.

However, after hearing about the app [Zero](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zero-fasting-tracker/id1168348542?mt=8) I decided to give fasting a try. At first, I would stop eating at sunset and fast for a minimum of 13 hours.  Using the app allowed me to track my progress and get alerts and see some early results correlated to fasting.

### Theory

To learn more about the science behind fasting I read [Complete Guide to Fasting](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Guide-Fasting-Intermittent-Alternate-Day/dp/1628600012) by Dr. Jason Fung. He is a doctor specializing diseases of the kidneys and has focused on how fasting can reverse Type-2 Diabetes. This is a fascinating book that I highly recommend.

A major part of the book is Dr. Fung's explanation of how eating affects your body particularly related to insulin. Each time you eat your body produces insulin which triggers your body to store reserves and prevents your body from using fat stores for energy.

Conversely, a high fat, low carb diet combined with fasting allows your body to more easily enter [Ketosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis) (use fats for energy) and thus burn fats.

When we are always eating, even if small meals, our bodies will produce insulin and thus have a hard time getting rid of fat stores.

### Tweaking my Routine

Armed with this knowledge I started doing 24-hour fasts, dinner of one day to dinner of the next, 3 times per week.

I figured I'd be extremely hungry while fasting, but found that just drinking some water, coffee, or tea when I felt a wave of "hunger" was all that I needed to get back on track. Other than a few waves I've found that I actually don't feel like I'm starving while fasting. Turns out "hunger pains" are more related to routine than our bodies really need to eat.

### Reaping the Benefits

* Weight loss
* Grocery bill savings
* Simplified morning routine
* Energy level

I feel great on fasting days and don't miss any fellowship with my family as I can eat with my whatever we are having for dinner. I also save time as I rarely eat breakfast or pack lunch to take to work.

When I've done calorie reduction diets in the past it has left me feeling lethargic all day, but while fasting I feel energized. No food coma after lunch and an increased metabolism ([BMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate)). So while still eating normally (mostly Paleo) and not counting calories at all, I've lost significant weight (35 pounds so far).

Since the 70s dieting has become a marketing-driven industry and nobody makes money when you just don't eat. Fasting seems to be making a comeback and I wish more people knew about this simple strategy to improve their health.

Fasting makes so much sense to me after doing it for a while. Almost every world religion has a history of fasting and I can see why given the benefits. At times it feels like I've unlocked a major lifehack that both saves time/money and improves my wellbeing.

This coming year I'm also planning to try some 7+ day fasts. Would love to hear if you try your own fasting experiment.
