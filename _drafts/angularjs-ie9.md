### When well

* HTML5 mode fallback worked great, link between browsers work
* Microsoft VMs to test versions
  * alias 10.0.2.2 to localhost

### Changes to make

* Proxy APIs
  * No CORS support
  * Example nginx conf
* File uploads
  * flash fallback

### Issues

* Debugging random error messages
  * Firebug lite

### Future

* Test sooner
* Test on regular basis
