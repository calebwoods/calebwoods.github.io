I read a lot of blog posts. It's a key part of learning for me to stay on top of learning related to my career. There is one thing about a number of blogs that irritates me poor readability.

By no means am I an expert in typography. I'm a developer, but readability and eye strain are things I try reduce everyday. I use a large font in my text editor and read most of my books on a Kindle paper white. As someone who already wears contacts in my 20s and plans to be working on a computer for the rest of my career I want to maintain my vision as much as possible.

The issue is not that some blogs don't have good readability on some screen sizes, they do. However, not every blog has taken into account the various sizes that users will be reading their content.

I've tried to do better job of this with my recent redesign of my blog.  I'll share some tool and techniques that I've used to make my content as readable as possible across device sizes.

* Characters per line
  * Condensed font
  * http://www.pearsonified.com/typography/
* Breaking lines `&shy;`
* Good headings - scan-ability
